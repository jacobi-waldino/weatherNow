## JSON data chosen

I have choses the weather data json set for this website. 


## Brief description of web page developed (~150 words)

The web page (called "Weather Now") shows weather data in a table that can be sorted with a search bar. The search bar searches based on a match of the first letters of all of the city names when compared to the query. It also bolds an entry if there is an exact match to the search query. It shows a no results page if there are no matches found within the data for the proposed query. It's fairly minimalist, both in style and implementation, but it is effective in its simplicity. It also features a files tab that features all of the necessary requirements for supplemental files described in the assignment details.
